Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- for an MRI image fusion and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The patient has a 2.5 cc lesion located in the left frontal lobe. Dr. Galvan has elected to treat with a stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) technique by means of the BrainLAB Elements treatment planning system in conjunction with the Versa HD linear accelerator equipped with the ExacTrac system.

Days before radiation delivery, a rigid aquaplast head mask was constructed of the patient and was then fixated onto a stereotactic carbon fiber frame base. Dr. Galvan was present to verify correct construction of the head mask. A high resolution CT scan (1.2mm slice thickness) was then acquired. In addition, a previous high resolution MR image set (T1-weighted, post Gd contrast scan) was acquired. The MR images and CT images were fused within the BrainLAB Elements treatment planning system platform where a rigid body fusion was performed. The fusion was validated using nearby anatomical landmarks. CT images were also localized in BrainLAB Elements. Fusion and structure segmentation were reviewed by Dr. Galvan and Dr. Kirby.

A radiotherapy treatment plan was developed to deliver the prescribed dose to the periphery of the lesion. The treatment plan was optimized such that the prescription isodose volume geometrically matched the planning target volume (PTV) and that the lower isodose volumes spared the healthy brain tissue. The following summarizes the plan parameters:

• Rx Dose: 16 Gy in 1 fraction
• Target Volume: 2.5 cc
• Location: left frontal lobe
• Rx Isodose: 80%
• PTV Coverage: 98%
• Conformity Index: 1.2
• Gradient Index: 3
• Maximum Dose: 125%

Calculations and data analysis were reviewed and approved by both the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. Kirby.

Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- for an MRI image fusion and stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). The patient has a 15 cc lesion located in the right temporal lobe. Dr. Galvan has elected to treat with a stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) technique by means of the BrainLAB Elements treatment planning system in conjunction with the Versa HD linear accelerator equipped with the ExacTrac system.

Days before radiation delivery, a rigid aquaplast head mask was constructed of the patient and was then fixated onto a stereotactic carbon fiber frame base. Dr. Galvan was present to verify correct construction of the head mask. A high resolution CT scan (1.2mm slice thickness) was then acquired. In addition, a previous high resolution MR image set (T1-weighted, post Gd contrast scan) was acquired. The MR images and CT images were fused within the BrainLAB Elements treatment planning system platform where a rigid body fusion was performed. The fusion was validated using nearby anatomical landmarks. CT images were also localized in BrainLAB Elements. Fusion and structure segmentation were reviewed by Dr. Galvan and Dr. Kirby.

A radiotherapy treatment plan was developed to deliver the prescribed dose to the periphery of the lesion. The treatment plan was optimized such that the prescription isodose volume geometrically matched the planning target volume (PTV) and that the lower isodose volumes spared the healthy brain tissue. The following summarizes the plan parameters:

• Rx Dose: 35 Gy in 5 fractions
• Target Volume: 15 cc
• Location: right temporal lobe
• Rx Isodose: 80%
• PTV Coverage: 98%
• Conformity Index: 1.2
• Gradient Index: 3
• Maximum Dose: 125%

Calculations and data analysis were reviewed and approved by both the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. Kirby.

Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- for an MRI image fusion and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The patient has 5 brain lesions: a 1 cc lesion in the left frontal lobe, a 1.3 cc lesion in the right parietal lobe, a 1.6 cc lesion in the left temporal lobe, a 1.9 cc lesion in the right occipital lobe, and a 2.2 cc lesion in the cerebellum. Dr. Galvan has elected to treat with a stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) technique by means of the BrainLAB Elements treatment planning system in conjunction with the Versa HD linear accelerator equipped with the ExacTrac system.

Days before radiation delivery, a rigid aquaplast head mask was constructed of the patient and was then fixated onto a stereotactic carbon fiber frame base. Dr. Galvan was present to verify correct construction of the head mask. A high resolution CT scan (1.2mm slice thickness) was then acquired.

The MR images and CT images were fused within the BrainLAB Elements treatment planning system platform where a rigid body fusion was performed. The fusion was validated using nearby anatomical landmarks. CT images were also localized in BrainLAB Elements. Fusion and structure segmentation were reviewed by Dr. Galvan and Dr. Kirby.

A radiotherapy treatment plan was developed to deliver the prescribed doses to the periphery of each lesion. The treatment plan was optimized such that each prescription isodose volume geometrically matched the corresponding planning target volume (PTV) and that the lower isodose volumes spared the healthy brain tissue. The following summarizes the plan parameters for each lesion:

Lesion 1: left frontal lobe
• Volume: 1 cc
• Dose: 18 Gy in 1 fraction
• Rx Isodose: 80%
• PTV Coverage: 98%
• Conformity Index: 1.2
• Gradient Index: 3
• Maximum Dose: 125%

Lesion 2: right parietal lobe
• Volume: 1.3 cc
• Dose: 18 Gy in 1 fraction
• Rx Isodose: 80%
• PTV Coverage: 98%
• Conformity Index: 1.2
• Gradient Index: 3
• Maximum Dose: 125%

Lesion 3: left temporal lobe
• Volume: 1.6 cc
• Dose: 18 Gy in 1 fraction
• Rx Isodose: 80%
• PTV Coverage: 98%
• Conformity Index: 1.2
• Gradient Index: 3
• Maximum Dose: 125%

Lesion 4: right occipital lobe
• Volume: 1.9 cc
• Dose: 18 Gy in 1 fraction
• Rx Isodose: 80%
• PTV Coverage: 98%
• Conformity Index: 1.2
• Gradient Index: 3
• Maximum Dose: 125%

Lesion 5: cerebellum
• Volume: 2.2 cc
• Dose: 18 Gy in 1 fraction
• Rx Isodose: 80%
• PTV Coverage: 98%
• Conformity Index: 1.2
• Gradient Index: 3
• Maximum Dose: 125%

All lesions will be treated in a single fraction.

Calculations and data analysis were reviewed and approved by both the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. Kirby.
