```
Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- for a gated, DIBH treatment. Dr. Galvan has elected to treat the left breast using a DIBH technique to significantly reduce cardiac dose with the C-RAD positioning and gating system in conjunction with the linear accelerator.

Days before the initial radiation delivery, the patient was simulated in the treatment position using a breast board to aid in immobilization and localization. Instructions were provided and the patient was coached to reproducibly hold their breath. Using the C-RAD surface scanning system, a free breathing and breath hold signal trace was established. After reproducing the breath hold pattern and establishing a consistent breathing pattern, a gating baseline and gating window were created. Subsequently, a DIBH CT simulation scan was acquired and approved by the Radiation Oncologist, Dr. Galvan.

A radiation treatment plan was developed on the DIBH CT simulation to deliver a prescribed dose of 40 Gy in 15 fractions (2.67 Gy per fraction) to the left breast. The delivery of the DIBH gating technique on the linear accelerator will be performed using the C-RAD CatalystHD. The CatalystHD will be used to position the patient, monitor intra-fraction motion, and gate the beam delivery. Verification of the patient position will be validated with a DIBH kV-CBCT. Treatment plan calculations and delivery procedures were reviewed and approved by the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. Kirby.

Treatment plan calculations and delivery procedures were reviewed and approved by the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. Kirby.

### Test 18: Edge Case - Decimal Dose (45.6 Gy / 19 fx)

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Configuration:**
- Treatment Site: chest wall
- Dose: 45.6 Gy / 19 fractions
- Dose/Fraction: 2.40 Gy

**Generated Writeup:**

```
Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- for a gated, DIBH treatment. Dr. Galvan has elected to treat the chest wall using a DIBH technique to minimize breathing motion during radiation delivery with the C-RAD positioning and gating system in conjunction with the linear accelerator.

Days before the initial radiation delivery, the patient was simulated in the treatment position using a wing board to aid in immobilization and localization. Instructions were provided and the patient was coached to reproducibly hold their breath. Using the C-RAD surface scanning system, a free breathing and breath hold signal trace was established. After reproducing the breath hold pattern and establishing a consistent breathing pattern, a gating baseline and gating window were created. Subsequently, a DIBH CT simulation scan was acquired and approved by the Radiation Oncologist, Dr. Galvan.

A radiation treatment plan was developed on the DIBH CT simulation to deliver a prescribed dose of 45.60 Gy in 19 fractions (2.40 Gy per fraction) to the chest wall. The delivery of the DIBH gating technique on the linear accelerator will be performed using the C-RAD CatalystHD. The CatalystHD will be used to position the patient, monitor intra-fraction motion, and gate the beam delivery. Verification of the patient position will be validated with a DIBH kV-CBCT. Treatment plan calculations and delivery procedures were reviewed and approved by the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. Kirby.

A radiation treatment plan was developed on the DIBH CT simulation to deliver a prescribed dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions (2 Gy per fraction) to the chest wall. The delivery of the DIBH gating technique on the linear accelerator will be performed using the C-RAD CatalystHD. The CatalystHD will be used to position the patient, monitor intra-fraction motion, and gate the beam delivery. Verification of the patient position will be validated with a DIBH kV-CBCT.

### Test 20: Edge Case - Boost with Unusual Fractionation (42 Gy / 14 fx + 12 Gy / 3 fx)

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Configuration:**
- Treatment Site: left breast
- Dose: 42 Gy / 14 fractions
- Dose/Fraction: 3.00 Gy
- Boost: 12 Gy / 3 fractions
- Boost Dose/Fraction: 4.00 Gy
- **Total: 54 Gy / 17 fractions**

**Generated Writeup:**

```
Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- for a gated, DIBH treatment. Dr. Galvan has elected to treat the left breast using a DIBH technique to significantly reduce cardiac dose with the C-RAD positioning and gating system in conjunction with the linear accelerator.

Days before the initial radiation delivery, the patient was simulated in the treatment position using a breast board to aid in immobilization and localization. Instructions were provided and the patient was coached to reproducibly hold their breath. Using the C-RAD surface scanning system, a free breathing and breath hold signal trace was established. After reproducing the breath hold pattern and establishing a consistent breathing pattern, a gating baseline and gating window were created. Subsequently, a DIBH CT simulation scan was acquired and approved by the Radiation Oncologist, Dr. Galvan.

A radiation treatment plan was developed on the DIBH CT simulation to deliver a prescribed dose of 42 Gy in 14 fractions (3 Gy per fraction) to the left breast, followed by a boost of 12 Gy in 3 fractions (4 Gy per fraction) for a total dose of 54 Gy in 17 fractions. The delivery of the DIBH gating technique on the linear accelerator will be performed using the C-RAD CatalystHD. The CatalystHD will be used to position the patient, monitor intra-fraction motion, and gate the beam delivery. Verification of the patient position will be validated with a DIBH kV-CBCT. Treatment plan calculations and delivery procedures were reviewed and approved by the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the radiation oncology physicist, Dr. Kirby.
