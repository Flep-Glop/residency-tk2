### 16. Lesion: renal

**Anatomical Region:** abdominal

**Write-up:**

```
Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- to perform a multimodality image fusion. The patient was scanned in our CT simulator in the treatment position. The CT study was then exported to the Velocity imaging registration software.

Multiple image studies including one MRI study and one PET/CT study were imported into the Velocity software. Fusion studies were created between the planning CT and each of the imported image sets. The CT and MRI image sets were initially aligned using a rigid registration algorithm based on the abdominal anatomy, then refined manually. The resulting fusion was verified for accuracy using anatomical landmarks such as the kidney.

The CT and PET/CT image sets were aligned using a rigid registration algorithm followed by deformable image registration to enhance the results. The accuracy of this fusion was validated using anatomical structures such as the kidney. The fused images were subsequently used to improve the identification of critical structures and targets and to accurately contour them for treatment planning.

The fusions for all image sets were reviewed and approved by both the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the medical physicist, Dr. Kirby.

3. Validate article usage ('a' vs 'an' before anatomical terms)
4. Ensure custom lesions are properly substituted
5. Confirm consistent phrasing across similar lesion types
