### 1. Anatomical Region: abdominal

**Write-up:**

```
Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for --- to perform a multimodality image fusion. The patient was scanned in our CT simulator in the treatment position. This CT study was then exported to the Velocity imaging registration software.

An MRI study was imported into the Velocity software. A fusion study was created between the planning CT and the imported image set. The CT and MRI image sets were initially aligned using a rigid registration algorithm based on the abdominal anatomy, which was then further refined manually. The accuracy of this fusion was validated using anatomical landmarks. The fused images were used to improve the segmentation of organs at risk and targets as part of the treatment planning process.

The fusion of the image sets was reviewed and approved by both the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the medical physicist, Dr. Kirby.
