# Medical Physics Toolkit - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW DISCOVERY

### **Environment Variable Configuration Issue**
- **Location**: `frontend/.env.local`
- **Issue**: Frontend was configured to call **production Railway server** instead of local backend during development
- **Symptom**: Local code changes in backend had no effect on frontend testing
- **Root Cause**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://residency-tk2-production.up.railway.app/api`
- **Fix**: Updated to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api` for local development
- **Impact**: 
  - ✅ **BEFORE**: Hours of debugging why "working" backend changes weren't reflected in UI
  - ✅ **AFTER**: Immediate local development feedback loop restored
- **Lesson**: **ALWAYS verify API endpoints in browser DevTools Network tab when debugging**

**This was the root cause of the SBRT enhancement debugging session - the enhanced templates were working perfectly on localhost but the frontend was calling the old production server!**

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed "visual goggles" from DIBH write-ups**
- **Location**: `backend/app/services/dibh.py` line 82
- **Fix**: Removed the phrase "using visual goggles" from the DIBH writeup generation
- **Impact**: DIBH writeups now have cleaner, more professional language

### 2. **Fixed plural/singular issues in fusion write-ups**
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/fusion/FusionForm.jsx` and `backend/app/services/fusion.py`
- **Fixes**:
  - Improved logic for handling single vs multiple modalities
  - Added proper grammar checking for "was/were" and "study/studies"
  - Enhanced number-to-word conversion for better readability
  - Fixed inconsistent text between frontend and backend
  - **NEW**: Refined singular case flow: "one MRI was imported" → "An external MRI study was imported"
  - **NEW**: Changed landmark references from anatomical region to lesion name: "such as the thoracic" → "such as the breast"
  - **NEW**: Adjusted conclusion text: "The fusion of all image sets" → "The fusion of the image sets" for singular cases
  - **NEW**: Improved text flow for single registrations with "imported image set" instead of "other modality image set"
  - **NEW**: Enhanced plural case flow: "two MRIs were imported" → "Two external MRI studies were imported"
  - **NEW**: Improved plural grammar: "The resulting fusion was" → "The resulting fusions were" for multiple studies
  - **NEW**: Better handling of mixed modalities: "Multiple external image studies including..." with proper study terminology
  - **NEW**: Consistent use of "imported image sets" instead of "other modality image sets" for better clarity
  - **NEW**: Final conclusion improvement: "The fusion of all image sets" → "The fusions for all image sets" for better flow
  - **NEW**: Fixed edge cases: Prevented double 's' in "MRI studiess" and corrected "one PET/CT studies" → "one PET/CT study"
  - **NEW**: Fixed mixed modality grammar: PET/CT paragraphs now consider total registrations for proper "this/these fusion(s)" usage
  - **NEW**: Fixed variable scoping bug: Moved totalRegistrations calculation to prevent "Cannot access before initialization" error
  - **NEW**: Enhanced singular handling: Properly handles "one PET/CT studies" → "one PET/CT study" in mixed modality scenarios
  - **NEW**: Registration method respect: PET/CT paragraphs now check actual registration method (rigid vs deformable) instead of assuming deformable
  - **NEW**: MAJOR: Added comprehensive CT/CT fusion support - was completely missing before!
  - **NEW**: CT registration filtering: Now properly includes CT registrations in counts and text generation
  - **NEW**: CT paragraph generation: Added dedicated CT/CT fusion paragraphs with proper registration method detection
  - **NEW**: CT import text handling: Properly handles "one CT study" vs "two CT studies" in all scenarios
  - **NEW**: FINAL: Removed "external" from all fusion text for broader applicability - now uses "Two MRI studies were..." instead of "Two external MRI studies were..."
- **Impact**: Fusion writeups now have grammatically correct plural/singular forms with much more natural flow

### 3. **Disabled SBRT button**

## 📋 **Latest Session Updates (August 2025 - Pacemaker TG-203 Compliance Fixes)**

### **🎯 CRITICAL FIXES: Pacemaker Risk Assessment Algorithm**

#### **21. TG-203 Risk Assessment Algorithm Correction**
- **Location**: `backend/app/services/pacemaker_service.py` - `_calculate_risk_level()` method
- **Critical Issue**: Pacing-dependent patients with dose < 2 Gy were incorrectly classified as Low risk
- **Root Cause**: Misinterpretation of TG-203 flowchart decision logic
- **TG-203 Flowchart Logic**:
  - **Decision Point**: "Pacing-independent patient AND Dose on CIED < 2 Gy"
  - **YES Branch** → LOW-RISK: Only if BOTH conditions are true
  - **NO Branch** → MEDIUM-RISK: If either pacing-dependent OR dose ≥ 2 Gy
- **Algorithm Correction**:
  ```python
  # Before (Incorrect):
  if dose_category == "< 2 Gy":
      return "Low"  # Wrong for pacing-dependent patients
  
  # After (Correct):
  if not is_pacing_dependent and dose_category == "< 2 Gy":
      return "Low"  # YES branch: Both conditions must be true
  else:
      return "Medium"  # NO branch: Either condition fails
  ```
- **Impact**: 
  - **Clinical Case**: 8-year-old male, pacing-dependent, 0.5 Gy dose
  - **Before**: Incorrectly assessed as Low risk
  - **After**: Correctly assessed as Medium risk per TG-203 guidelines
  - **Recommendations**: Now includes "Device interrogation before, during, and after treatment"

#### **22. Updated Risk Assessment Matrix (TG-203 Compliant)**
- **Complete Risk Level Mapping**:
  | Pacing Dependency | Dose Category | Neutron | Risk Level | Notes |
  |------------------|---------------|---------|------------|-------|
  | Independent | < 2 Gy | No | **Low** | Only scenario for Low risk |
  | **Dependent** | **< 2 Gy** | **No** | **Medium** | **Fixed from Low** |
  | Independent | 2-5 Gy | No | **Medium** | NO branch per TG-203 |
  | Dependent | 2-5 Gy | No | **Medium** | Consistent with guideline |
  | Independent | > 5 Gy | No | **Medium** | High dose without pacing |
  | Dependent | > 5 Gy | No | **High** | High dose + pacing |
  | Any | Any | Yes + >5Gy | **High** | Neutron + high dose |
- **Validation**: All 13 automated tests pass with 100% success rate

#### **23. UI Layout and Spacing Improvements**
- **Location**: `frontend/src/components/pacemaker/PacemakerForm.jsx`
- **Button Overlap Issue**: Generate and Reset buttons were overlapping with input columns
- **Fix**: Added `mt={4}` (margin-top) to button container for proper vertical spacing
- **Layout Stability**: Maintained consistent 3-column grid layout regardless of writeup state
- **User Experience**: Improved visual hierarchy and element spacing for better usability

#### **24. Test Suite Validation and Updates**
- **Location**: `test_pacemaker_module.py`
- **Test Case Correction**: Updated "Medium Risk - No Pacing, Medium Dose" expected result
  - **Scenario**: Pacing-independent patient with 3.0 Gy dose
  - **Previous**: Expected Low risk (incorrect interpretation)
  - **Corrected**: Expected Medium risk (3.0 Gy is not < 2 Gy, goes to NO branch)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All risk assessment scenarios validated against TG-203
- **Automation Benefits**: Immediate validation of algorithm changes without manual testing

### **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Risk Assessment Algorithm Flow**
```python
def _calculate_risk_level(self, is_pacing_dependent: bool, dose_category: str, neutron_producing: bool) -> str:
    # Step 1: Highest risk - neutron producing AND dose > 5 Gy
    if neutron_producing and dose_category == "> 5 Gy":
        return "High"
    
    # Step 2: Medium/High risk scenarios - neutron OR high dose
    if neutron_producing or dose_category == "> 5 Gy":
        if not is_pacing_dependent and dose_category == "< 2 Gy":
            return "Low"  # Special case per TG-203
        elif is_pacing_dependent:
            return "High"
        else:
            return "Medium"
    
    # Step 3: TG-203 decision point - "Pacing-independent AND dose < 2 Gy"
    if not is_pacing_dependent and dose_category == "< 2 Gy":
        return "Low"  # YES branch - only Low risk scenario
    else:
        return "Medium"  # NO branch - all other scenarios
```

#### **UI Layout Consistency**
```jsx
// Grid Layout (Fixed):
<Grid templateColumns={{
  base: "1fr",
  md: "repeat(2, 1fr)", 
  lg: "repeat(3, 1fr)"  // Always 3 columns on large screens
}} gap={6}>

// Button Spacing (Fixed):
