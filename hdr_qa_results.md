## Suite 1: Standard Applicator Types

### Test 1: Vaginal Cylinder (VC) - 1 channel

**Status:** ✅ PASS

**Configuration:**
- Applicator Type: VC
- Treatment Site: gynecological
- Number of Channels: 1

**Generated Writeup:**

```
Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for ---. The patient elected to be treated with a temporary HDR implant using a vaginal cylinder connected to a remote afterloader containing Ir-192.

The applicator was implanted in our clinic with the patient in the lithotomy position. Once the applicator was implanted and fixed to the patient, a CT scan of 3 mm slice thickness was acquired. This was used to contour critical structures (bladder, rectum, intestines, and sigmoid) and determine the treatment volume. The applicators were digitized in Oncentra and customized dwell weightings of the radioactive source were determined to optimally treat the target volume and reduce the dose to the nearby normal tissues. Once the optimal plan was determined, a second calculation was performed to verify the accuracy of the initial dose calculation and the patient was connected to the afterloader unit using one channel for treatment. The treatment was delivered with the Radiation Oncologist and Medical Physicist present.

The patient and the room were surveyed at the completion of the treatment. The room, patient, and personnel were cleared from radiation safety that recorded readings of less than 0.2 mR/hr in all surveyed areas. The calculations and surveys were reviewed and approved by both the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the medical physicist, Dr. Kirby.

**Generated Writeup:**

```
Dr. Galvan requested a medical physics consultation for ---. The patient elected to be treated with a temporary HDR implant using a vaginal cylinder connected to a remote afterloader containing Ir-192.

The applicator was implanted in our clinic with the patient in the lithotomy position. Once the applicator was implanted and fixed to the patient, a CT scan of 3 mm slice thickness was acquired. This was used to contour critical structures (bladder, rectum, intestines, and sigmoid) and determine the treatment volume. The applicators were digitized in Oncentra and customized dwell weightings of the radioactive source were determined to optimally treat the target volume and reduce the dose to the nearby normal tissues. Once the optimal plan was determined, a second calculation was performed to verify the accuracy of the initial dose calculation and the patient was connected to the afterloader unit using one channel for treatment. The treatment was delivered with the Radiation Oncologist and Medical Physicist present.

The patient and the room were surveyed at the completion of the treatment. The room, patient, and personnel were cleared from radiation safety that recorded readings of less than 0.2 mR/hr in all surveyed areas. The calculations and surveys were reviewed and approved by both the prescribing radiation oncologist, Dr. Galvan, and the medical physicist, Dr. Kirby.
